## Overview
In the tourism and travel-related industries, accurate demand forecasting is crucial for maximizing revenue and optimizing operations. Traditionally, most of the research in Revenue Management has focused on the aviation sector, utilizing the Passenger Name Record (PNR) format. However, other segments like hospitality, cruising, and theme parks have unique characteristics that cannot be fully addressed using aviation-specific data. 

To bridge this gap, we provide two hotel datasets that contain rich demand data, particularly useful for predicting the likelihood of a hotel booking being canceled. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can optimize their booking strategies, reduce no-show rates, and improve revenue management. Additionally, these datasets can be used for a variety of other predictive modeling tasks, such as forecasting occupancy rates, optimizing pricing strategies, and understanding customer booking behaviors.

One of the key challenges in building reliable prediction models is preventing data leakage, where future information inadvertently influences the model's predictions. To mitigate this, the data was collected in a manner that ensures the target variable's timestamp occurs after the input variablesâ€™ timestamp. Specifically, instead of extracting variables directly from the bookings database, the data was sourced from the bookings change log, with each variable's value reflecting the state as of the day before the arrival date.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle: [Hotel Booking Demand Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand/data). The original research article providing further details can be accessed here: [Original Article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191).

## Prerequisites
Before deploying the project, the following prerequisites are necessary:

- Docker and Docker Compose: For running the containerized environment.
- An AWS account: To access AWS services such as AWS EC2, AWS S3 and AWS RDS.
- Terraform: For automating the deployment of cloud resources.
- Familiarity with CLI operations: As the deployment and interaction with the project are largely conducted through the command line.

## Deployment Guide

### Local Environment Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JorgeAbrego/hotel-booking-mlops-project.git
   cd hotel-booking-mlops-project
   ```
2. **Create .env file**:
   Rename `example.env` to `.env` and replace the values with your own.
   ```bash
   move .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

3. **Setup Docker**:
   - Ensure Docker is installed on your local machine.
   - Build and start the Docker containers:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d --build
     ```

4. **Access Services**:
   - MLflow will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
   - Airflow can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080`.
   - PgAdmin can be accessed at `http://localhost:8888`.
   - Minio can be accessed at `http://localhost:9001`.
   - Grafana will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Cloud Deployment with Terraform
1. **Install Terraform**:
   - Follow the instructions on the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) to install Terraform on your local machine.

2. **Configure Cloud Provider**:
   - Set up your AWS credentials and configure them using Terraform. Ensure your provider configuration is correctly set in `main.tf`.
